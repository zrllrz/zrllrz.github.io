Course Description
======
Robots have become a pervasive part of our lives, evolving from obscure novelties to indispensable components of modern life. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, robots have become an increasingly integral part of our society and daily lives. With each stride in robot technology, tasks that were once solely within the domain of human capability are now effortlessly executed by robotic counterparts, heralding a new era of efficiency and innovation.

In an era marked by the swift evolution of AI, the field of robotics is experiencing unprecedented growth and innovation. Throughout this course, we will delve into a series of fundamentals at the heart of this technological revolution and try to answer the following questions: What led us to the current state of robotics? How do robots play an essential role across diverse sectors? Why do robots possess the remarkable capabilities that enable them to undertake tasks that were once deemed impossible? How does AI benefit robots in the era of big data? How do robots contribute to the Hong Kong community and society at large? Do robots only benefit humanity, or do there exist costs and concerns that necessitate careful consideration? What groundbreaking horizons lie ahead as we stride towards the future alongside robots?

This course is fundamentally transdisciplinary and is designed for students who are new to robotics and AI. We will cultivate a foundational understanding of AI-driven robotics. The course will focus on the role of robotics in our society, considering its practical and potential uses, and how it can dramatically revolutionize our society in the future. This course does not assume previous knowledge.
